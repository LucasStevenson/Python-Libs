# create a numpy array using arange. A numpy array is a grid of values. They are similar to lists, except that every element of an array must be the same type. Write a program that will print the following ouput

# desired output:
# [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

# numpy arrays are better in terms of faster computation and ease of manipulation

import numpy as np

arr = np.arange(10)

print(arr)
